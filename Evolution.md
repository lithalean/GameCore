### Decision Metrics
```yaml
impact_score: 9  # HIGH - completes rendering pipeline
complexity_score: 5  # MODERATE - required precise configuration
success_score: 10  # EXCEEDED - works perfectly on all platforms
time_to_implement: 4 hours
lines_changed: ~200
files_affected: 3
```

### The Problem
```yaml
symptoms:
  - MetalGridRenderer had dark background (0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 1.0)
  - Sky not visible through grid
  - tvOS buttons completely non-functional
  - Platform visual inconsistencies

root_cause: |
  Grid renderer not configured for transparency
  Missing blend pipeline configuration
  tvOS using deprecated .focusable() API
  No proper focus state management

severity: HIGH
user_impact: "Incomplete visual pipeline, tvOS unusable"
```

### The Decision
```yaml
chosen_solution: "Full transparency pipeline + Modern tvOS APIs"
alternatives_considered:
  workaround_transparency:
    pros: ["Quick fix possible"]
    cons: ["Not proper solution", "Platform differences"]
    complexity: 3
    
  partial_transparency:
    pros: ["Easier to implement"]
    cons: ["Visual artifacts", "Not production quality"]
    complexity: 4
    
  full_transparency:
    pros: ["Perfect visuals", "Platform consistency", "Production ready"]
    cons: ["Requires careful configuration"]
    complexity: 5
    selected: true

tvos_solution:
  - Replace .focusable() with @FocusState

  - Add proper visual feedback
  - Scale up on focus (1.1x)

decision_criteria:
  - Visual quality must be perfect
  - All platforms must work identically
  - No visual artifacts allowed
  - tvOS must be fully functional
```

### The Implementation
```swift
// MetalGridRenderer.swift - Full Transparency
override init() {
    // Clear color with full transparency
    metalView.clearColor = MTLClearColorMake(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    metalView.framebufferOnly = false
    
    // Platform-specific transparency
    #if os(macOS)
    metalView.layer?.isOpaque = false
    #else
    metalView.isOpaque = false
    metalView.backgroundColor = .clear
    #endif
}

private func setupPipeline() {
    // Enable blending for transparency
    descriptor.colorAttachments[0].isBlendingEnabled = true
    descriptor.colorAttachments[0].sourceRGBBlendFactor = .sourceAlpha
    descriptor.colorAttachments[0].destinationRGBBlendFactor = .oneMinusSourceAlpha
}

// TitleButton.swift - tvOS Modern Focus
struct TitleButton: View {
    @State private var isPressed = false
    #if os(tvOS)
    @FocusState private var isFocused: Bool
    #endif
    
    var body: some View {
        Button(action: action) {
            // Content
        }
        #if os(tvOS)
        .buttonStyle(CardButtonStyle())
        .focused($isFocused)
        .onChange(of: isFocused) { focused in
            withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.15)) {
                isPressed = focused
            }
        }
        .frame(minWidth: 300, maxWidth: 400, minHeight: 80)
        .scaleEffect(isPressed ? 1.1 : 1.0)
        #endif
    }
}
```

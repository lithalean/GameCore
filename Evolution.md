    cons: ["Over-engineered", "Complex state management"]
    complexity: 9
    
  persistent_layer:
    pros: ["Simple", "Effective", "Clean architecture"]
    cons: ["Requires navigation redesign"]
    complexity: 5
    selected: true

decision_criteria:
  - Simplicity > Complexity
  - Architectural clarity
  - Future maintainability

```

### The Implementation
```diff
// MainGameView.swift

- }

+ ZStack {
+     // PERSISTENT LAYER - Created once
+     if !showSplash {
+         TitleBackground()
+         TitleScreenView()  // Single RealityKit instance
+     }
+     
+     // FLOATING CONTENT - Only this changes
+     NavigationStack(path: $gameStateManager.navigationPath) {
+         TitleScreenContent()
+     }
+ }

// GridStateManager.swift (NEW)
+ @Observable class GridStateManager {
+     static let shared = GridStateManager()
+     private(set) var activeGrids: [String: Entity] = [:]
+     
+     func register(_ entity: Entity, id: String) {
+         activeGrids[id] = entity
+     }
